### Exp 1 : Rule Based Chatbot

### Exp 2 : Sentiment Analysis
To analyze peopleâ€™s sentiments and classify movie reviews. I used the following models:
- Multinomial Naive Bayes - achieved an accuracy of 60%
- BERT model to improve the accuracy - improved accuracy to 69.32%

### Exp 3 : 

### Exp 4 : 

### Exp 5 : 

### Exp 6 : Measuring Document similarity
In this Exp, I will be exploring 
- Cosine Similarity, 
- improving the model with TF-IDF and 
- GloVe to measure similarity between 2 documents. 
- Also I will be exploring the application of Plagiarism Checker using the final Cosine model.
